## 📌 Project Overview
Understanding what drives sustainability success is complex and critical for impactful policy making.  
This project uses a **Random Forest machine learning model** to analyze key sustainability factors across countries.  
It identifies the most important drivers like digital transformation, governance, education, and renewable energy adoption.

---

## 🎯 Business Goal
- **Challenge**: Sustainability efforts often lack clear prioritization due to complex, interconnected factors.  
- **Objective**: Use AI to uncover key sustainability drivers and guide data-driven policy decisions.  
- **Outcome**: Clear insights into critical impact areas, supporting more effective sustainability strategies.

---

## 📊 Data & Features
- Structured, country-level sustainability indicators covering economy, environment, social, and governance aspects.  
- Includes time-series data where available for historical trend analysis.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Applied **Random Forest classification and feature importance analysis**.  
- Model explains which factors most influence sustainability success.
